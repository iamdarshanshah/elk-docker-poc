# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker

Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/master/docker)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/dev/build/tasks/os_packages/docker_generator)

## Requirements

### Host setup

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version **17.05+**
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.12.0+**
* 1.5 GB of RAM

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:
* 5000: Logstash TCP input
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

## Usage

### Bringing up the stack

Clone this repository onto the Docker host that will run the stack, then start services locally using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by adding the `-d` flag to the above command.

> :information_source: You must run `docker-compose build` first whenever you switch branch or update a base image.

If you are starting the stack for the very first time, please read the section below attentively.

### Cleanup

Elasticsearch data is persisted inside a volume by default.

In order to entirely shutdown the stack and remove all persisted data, use the following Docker Compose command:

```console
$ docker-compose down -v
```
